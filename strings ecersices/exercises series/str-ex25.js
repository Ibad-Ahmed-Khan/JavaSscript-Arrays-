// program to create a Caesar encryption.
// Note : In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher,
//  Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption
// techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext
// is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
//  For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and
//  so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
